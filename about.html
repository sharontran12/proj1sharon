  <h1>Recollection</h1>
  <h2>Scrapbooking is a form of storytelling and a place to hold pieces of your memories combined with words or emojis to document your life in a meaningful way. Underneath a typical scrapbook that would usually include glitter, stickers, and decoration. For this particular scrapbook, I hope to focus on the true meaning of a scrapbook which would include simple designs.
</h2>
  <h2>For project 1, I created a virtual scrapbook that would emulate a physical scrapbook. While taking into consideration what a physical scrapbook would include, I added some personalized assets using HTML and CSS. As many people would flip a book, I used buttons as emulation for people to interact with the virtual scrapbook.</h2>
  <h2>I used my personal images ranging from food, childhood, and growing into adult life pictures that led me to where I am. This form of a virtual scrapbook’s goal is to bring warmth and nostalgic memories. And it also gives the audience to get to know more about me and insights into my life. </h2>
  <h2>As for the website design, I wanted to keep it minimalistic and simple using the main color brown as it is the color that represents soil and growth. The title of this scrapbook called “Recollection”. If I could sum up my virtual scrapbook into one word, I would title it “Recollection” since the title has a powerful meaning of recalling to mind or the reflections of memories. </h2>
